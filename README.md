**Description:**

 Z2 is a sideproject of mine that I just sat down and startet coding the other day. I started with creating a new compass bar and just went from there. The result is what you see here. No external assets are used with the exception of the compass bar which is hosted online. This makes the mod server friendly, no client downloads required unless one opts for the optional 10s toolbelt and target healthbar patches which will require the clients to install DMT mods.

Worktime: 3-4h (initial sketchup) Worktime: 6-7h (fine tuning, touchups, changes)

New feature: This is coded as a HUD killer. This means that it can be dropped into an overhaul mod and will likely kill the overhauls HUD and replace it with Z2. Adaptation might be needed depending on overhaul features.

Z2 is somewhat scale friendly. Due to the art lines extreme scaling can cause issues.

 

It is also highly customizable through the styles.xml file. So if orange is not your thing, change it there by setting a new r,g,b color in the correct style entry. 


> Dependencies: None.

> Compatibility: Will work with all mods/modlets that doesn't modify the contents of the XUi folder.
